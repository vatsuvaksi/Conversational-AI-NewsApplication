const alanKey = 'a6b85e7735320e3cec61034b9ac003592e956eca572e1d8b807a3e2338fdd0dc/stage'; //This is the personal key to the project for integration with this react Application

// SOME SELF NOTES
// 1) onCommand () =>();      
/*This will work with either with switch or if and it will run as many commands as we want*/
// Working with ALAN AI

/* WORKING WITH ALAN */
/*
After creating the project on alan ai's website
the syntax is =>
1) Simple play
intent("Command1","command2","command3","...commandN",
reply("This is the reply that you want"));
2) Trigger play
intent('this is a command',(p)=>{
p.play("this will be played ");
});
3) Trigger a command
intent("start a commnd" , (p)=>{
    p.play({
        command: "testCommand"
    });
});
and in the js file inside oncammand we pass a param command inside the alan button 
 onCommand : ({command}) =>{
                if(command === 'testCommand'){
                    alert("this code was executed");
                }
            }
        })


 4)Using external API in ALAN
 fetch the api key and store in a const value
 then use
const API_KEY='a72bbd5e080e4cb2934540fd2d4e4670'; // This is the api key to NEWS API 
let savedArticles=[];

intent('Give me the news from $(source* (.*))',(p)=>{
    let NEWS_API_URL =`https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?apiKey=${API_KEY}`;  //here ES6 is added for personalising the api key
     if(p.source.value){
        NEWS_API_URL =`${NEWS_API_URL}&sources=${p.source.value.toLowerCase().split(" ").join("-")}`;      //here we are appending the url with source from voice and then we are splitting it so that the spaces between the words become a sentence and and then joining it again with a - so that it becomes a string like the url

    }
     api.request(NEWS_API_URL,(error,response,body)=>{      //This is how apis are called in alan this is the syntax
        const {articles} = JSON.parse(body);            // This line will get the article from the body of the Json file after it's done parsing
        if(!articles.length){                            //This will check if the user's given source is valid or not
            p.play('Sorry, Please try from some other source'); 
            return;
        }
        savedArticles=articles;                                // initialised an empty array earlier now articles from the s=json file would be saved here
        p.play({
            command:'newHeadlines',                            // This is how the command is given so that 
            articles                                         
        });
        p.play(
            `Here are the latest (latest|related) ${p.source.values} news`      // it will play the latest news from the source
        )
    });

    });
